This is a template for quickly setting up a repository for a new project.

## Background

Lately, I've found myself spending a lot of time setting up the same basics for multiple new repositories. To help make this process easier, I decided to set up this repository template based on the basic tooling I use in nearly every new project these days.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository, run `npm install` and update any necessary settings.

You probably also want upgrade any out-of-date dependencies:

```sh
npm run deps:upgrade
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
